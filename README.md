# AxiomPHP


1. Introduction-- I am starting this as a new PHP framework from the ground up.  I have used some of the others and while they have there strengths there are also something else about building your own Framework...  It introduces skill, something I pride myself on.

2. Created the folder and file structure of the MVC pattern. 
During Unit testing created the Post.php file in the models folder. The following is what I used to confirm that the database was able to connect.

/* <?php
 * class Post{
 *   private $db;
 *
 *   public function __construct(){
 *       $this->db = new Database;
 *
 *   }
*/ }
